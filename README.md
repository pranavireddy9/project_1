Using Streamlit, Mongodb, SQL this project provides a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.

Libraries and Tools used:
The following are the required tools used:
STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.
